			<h2>Fantastic Flavorful Funkiness!</h2>
			<p>
				What is art? There are many different opinions with compelling arguments in
				regards to that question. Some say that art has to be objectively beautiful,
				and others argue that anything is art as long as it expresses something
				meaningful to someone &lpar;anyone really&rpar;. The term “food” too, is hard
				to define. Is food anything that tastes good? That can&apos;t be right.
				Anything that is healthy? No. Anything you can put in your mouth and swallow that
				won&apos;t kill you? You'd be surprised. Whatever the case, there are many
				fascinating things that, whether they should be classified as food or not, people
				eat all over the world.
