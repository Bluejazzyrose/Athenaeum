			<h2>Marvelous Feats of Nature</h2>
			<p>
				Sometimes we, as humans, need to be humbled. So God thought &quot;I know,
				I&apos;ll just occasionally really weird them out.&quot; All joking aside though,
				the world does do the most perplexing things. Sometimes it is a spectacular celestial display,
				and sometimes it is something only noticed by those who devote their life to witnessing that one anomaly.
				A lot of the things on this list are still yet to be fully understood,
				but that doesn&apos;t mean we can&apos;t appreciate them.

					<img src="phenomena/asperitas.png" alt="asperitas">
					<button data-dialog-target="asperitas">Asperitas</button>
					<dialog id="asperitas">
						<p>
						Rare, wave-like clouds that look like a rough sea from below.
						Though the formation itself does not produce rainfall, asperitas
						have been linked to thunderstorms, often occurring after one.

				<div>
					<img src="phenomena/lenticular.png" alt="lenticular">
					<button data-dialog-target="lenticular">Lenticular</button>
					<dialog id="lenticular">
						<p>
						Stationary, lens-shaped clouds that form in the troposphere.
						They are often seen over mountains, hills, or tall buildings.
						They used to be, and probably still are, often mistaken for flying saucers.

					<img src="phenomena/mammatus.png" alt="mammatus">
					<button data-dialog-target="mammatus">Mammatus</button>
					<dialog id="mammatus">
						<p>
						Pouch-shaped clouds that hang from the base of a cloud.
						A sign that severe weather, like thunderstorms, may be
						approaching or passing. They are most visible when the
						sun is low in the sky and they are usually formed in warm months.

					<button data-dialog-target="morning_glory">Morning Glory</button>
					<dialog id="morning_glory">
						<p>
						Being one of the rarest types of clouds, morning glory clouds
						only predictably form in Australia. They, as their name suggests,
						mostly only form in the morning and disappear when the day gets warmer.

					<img src="phenomena/aurora.png" alt="aurora">
					<button data-dialog-target="aurora">Northern &amp; Southern Lights</button>
					<dialog id="aurora">
						<p>
						The aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights,
						is visible from the Arctic, including Alaska, Canada,
						Iceland, and Russia. The aurora australis, also known as
						the southern lights, is visible from Antarctica,
						South Africa, Australasia, and the Southern Cone.

					<button data-dialog-target="fire_rainbows">Fire Rainbows</button>
					<dialog id="fire_rainbows">
						<p>
						Also known as a circumhorizontal arc, fire rainbows are a colorful,
						shimmering band in the sky that occurs when sunlight passes through
						ice crystals in cirrus clouds. They are not true rainbows nor related
						to fire. They can be seen from hundreds of miles away and are visible for hours.

					<img src="phenomena/light_pillars.png" alt="light pillars">
					<button data-dialog-target="light_pillars">Light Pillars</button>
					<dialog id="light_pillars">
						<p>
						A striking optical phenomenon that occurs when light
						is refracted by ice crystals in the air. They appear
						as vertical beams of light that extend from a light
						source, such as streetlights or the sun. Light pillars
						are most likely to occur on very cold, humid nights with little wind.

				<div>
					<img src="phenomena/moonbow.png" alt="moonbow">
					<button data-dialog-target="moonbow">Moonbow</button>
					<dialog id="moonbow">
						<p>
						A rare rainbow caused by light from the moon. They are faint
						and sort of boring looking because the moon gives barely any
						light compared to the sun, but it sure sounds cool.
