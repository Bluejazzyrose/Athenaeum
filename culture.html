			<h2>Folk Tales by the Fireside</h2>
			<p>
				Of all the things in this baffling world, humans are perhaps the most so.
				Therefore, the crazy things our minds cook up should probably be expected,
				but we still seem to surprise ourselves quite frequently. The things humans
				think of can be beautiful, disturbing, and everything in between,
				but all of it contributes to what we call culture.
			</p>
			<p>
				Culture can come in the form of traditions, beliefs, behavior&mdash;even clothing.
				Letâ€™s take a look at some of the more bizarre products of culture.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Creatures of Folklore</h3>

					<dialog id="adaro">
						<p>
						In the mythology of the Solomon Islands,
						Adaro are both ghosts and elemental spirits,
						with a sharp fin atop their head. They are said
						to be created by the sun dancing on the waves,
						and are associated with rainbows.
						They can shoot deadly projectiles&mdash;sometimes
						poison water, sometimes poison fish.

						<p>
						Also known as bushmen. Its main diet is humans,
						which it eats with its extremely elongated teeth.
						They are said to target lone desert travelers at night.
						The monster is said to have its eyes on its feet,
						meaning that it cannot see as it hunts. In order to see,
						it must stand on its hands or head, or lie in the sand.

					<button data-dialog-target="blemmyae">Blemmyae</button>
					<dialog id="blemmyae">
						<p>
						Greek creatures that are missing a head and wear their faces
						on their chest. Said to inhabit remote parts of the world.
						They most likely came from a mistranslation of an insult,
						from calling a group of people &quot;brainless&quot; to
						calling them &quot;headless&quot;.

					<button data-dialog-target="hitostume_kozo">Hitostume-kozo</button>
					<dialog id="hitostume_kozo">
						<p>
						A Y&omacr;kai &lpar;supernatural apparition&rpar; of Japan
						that takes on the appearance of a bald-headed child with one
						eye in the center of its forehead, similar to a cyclops. They
						generally do not cause any injury, are said to suddenly appear
						and surprise people, and are a comparatively harmless type of y&omacr;kai.

					<img src="culture/kappa.png" alt="kappa">
					<button data-dialog-target="kappa">Kappa</button>
					<dialog id="kappa">
						<p>
						Or river children. Typically described as  human-like beings with
						webbed hands and feet and turtle-like carapaces on their backs. A
						depression on the head retains water, and if this is damaged or its
						liquid is lost, a kappa becomes severely weakened. They are partial
						to cucumbers and sumo-wrestling. Dangerous but not evil.

					<img src="culture/myrmecoleon.png" alt="myrmecoleon">
					<button data-dialog-target="myrmecoleon">Myrmecoleon</button>
					<dialog id="myrmecoleon">
						<p>
						A hybrid between an ant and a lion. Most likely derived from an error in
						the Septuagint version of the book of Job. An alternate, less interesting
						interpretation of the Myrmecoleon is a lion of ants, or a very large ant.
						But that&apos;s no fun, so we&apos;ll ignore it.

						from Scottish folklore that brings death and disease. It&apos;s said to live in
						the sea and emerge onto land to cause havoc. It stalks its prey for days,
						appearing in the distance to cause fear and panic.

					<dialog id="shj">
						<p>
						An entity in English folklore, His bizarre appearance and ability to
						make extraordinary leaps made him quite popular. Jack was described
						as having a frightful appearance, with clawed hands, and eyes of red
						flames. He was tall and thin, with the appearance of a gentleman.
						Several reports mention that he could breathe out blue and white flames.
