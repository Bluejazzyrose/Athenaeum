			<h2>What Is an Athenaeum?</h2>
			<img src="temple.png" alt="Temple of Athena">
			<p>
				The term “athenaeum” originates from the Greek “Athenaion,” referring to a temple dedicated to Athena, the
				goddess of wisdom, where poets and scholars gathered to read and discuss their work. Today the word athenaeum
				means a building or institution dedicated to the promotion of learning. In the context of this website the
				term is referring to the fact that in exploring it you would have to be either extremely knowledgeable or
				extremely dense in order to escape learning something new.

			<h2>Unusual Insights, Brought to Your Fingertips</h2>
			<p>
				What do you say we have a go at making all these unusual insights a little more usual? Because if nothing is
				special, everything is. That being said, at the moment there are still things that aren&apos;t special, so
				let&apos;s focus on things that are. There are so many amazing things most people have never heard of that
				really have no excuse for being obscure. Then there are the ones that do have an excuse, like being almost
				extinct, barely discovered, or illegal in most countries. Either way, I plan to inform you of them whether
				they deserve it or not. From obscure creatures with bizarre features, to plants that look like anything but,
				to unusual traditions being followed in remote corners of the world, there is knowledge and awe to be gained
				all around us, and we can draw inspiration from these amazing epiphanies, oddities, and natural wonders.
