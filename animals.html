			<h2>Amazing Animalia</h2>
			<p>
				Who doesn&apos;t love animals to some degree? We&apos;re not counting angsty adolescent
				boys&mdash;they&apos;ll grow out of it. The correct answer is nobody. Many ancient civilizations
				have worshiped different kinds of animals, and a good amount of modern ones too; a large portion
				of fairy- and folktales center around animals or half animals. This might be because we can&apos;t
				escape them completely, no matter what we try, and so we might as well welcome them into our lives.
				It might be because they remind us of the unexplored wilderness and the places man can&apos;t go,
				which appeals to our curious nature. Or it might be that we see something of ourselves in animals,
				and so want to understand them as a method of learning more about ourselves. Or, of course, it could
				be all three. Either way, let’s indulge that instinct for a while.
